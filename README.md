# BookSwap - Share. Swap. Explore.

## R1 - Description of the website

**Purpose:**

BookSwap is an online platform designed to connect book enthusiasts and facilitate the sharing of books within a community of readers. The primary purpose of the platform is to foster a sense of community, encourage book sharing, and provide a convenient way for users to explore and borrow books from fellow readers.

The organisation Konyvek.hu has shown interest in integrating the application into their existing platform. To facilitate this, they have assigned a resource named Jozsef to collaborate on the project. Jozsef's responsibilities include defining the project scope, participating in standup meetings, and conducting user testing.

Please note that the inclusion of Konyvek.hu as part of the context is purely fictional and has been added solely for assessment purposes.

**Functionality/Features:**

In collaboration with Jozsef, we have identified three tiers of functionality based on the applied agile methodology. These tiers define the progressive levels of features of the project. By dividing the these functionalities into tiers, we can prioritise and implement them incrementally, ensuring a focused and efficient development process. The customer expressed their satisfaction with the Minimal Value Product (MVP) scope and stated that any additional features implemented would be considered a bonus.

1. Minimal Value Product

- User Registration: Users can sign up and create an account.
- User Login: Users can log in to access their account.
- Book Listing Management for Lenders: Lenders can create, list, update, and delete their book listings.
